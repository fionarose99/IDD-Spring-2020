## Problems
So, as it turns out, I do ***not*** have a color-changing LED. XD 

I thought Charles and I (I was there; not gonna try to put all this on him lol) had gotten together everything I'd need back in DC, right around the time I came back to classes &mdash; and I should've checked &mdash; but I did not. So, tonight, I went on AdaFruit. Then, I bought the wrong kind of LED &mdash; ones that aren't programmable. THEN, I got on DigiKey and found the right kind (I think). Both (the wrong kind and the right kind) are supposed to arrive here by Monday (5/11/20).

### Hardware Setup
The "Teensy1" and "Teensy2" .jpeg's are photos where I've set up my breadboard for A01. I wired up both the potentiometer and the encoder, just in case. The encoder is set up with just the knob, i.e. without the optional button-type switch (which I gather use the 2 pins opposite the set of 3 pins I ***am*** using). There are wires set up for the color-changing LED, assuming a 4-pin pinout. Everything else is set up. All I'll have to do is correct anything that needs fixing and plug that right in.

### Questions
* Could you check out my wiring and see if you find anywhere I might have problems? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unsure of the potentiometer and rotary encoder hookups especially; I connected the potentiometer to AC ports and the encoder to DC ports (I think), and though I know how to do it &mdash; especially the potentiometer after **LAST** semester (lol) &mdash; but it's been awhile since I've done a potentiometer hookup and I've never done an encoder hookup before. (Also, I had a lot of trouble finding specific info on what the pinout for that encoder was.) I think I did it right. But could you take a look at that specifically?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I don't have a nut and washer for the rotary encoder. Is that okay?

* I spent ~$15-20 on the LEDs all told, because of shipping and getting the wrong one (sorry about that, again &ndash; XD). Is there any way I could get reimbursed for that? (Thank you, NASA? XD)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put PDFs of my receipts from DigiKey ("DigiKey Color-Changing LEDs Receipt (Full).pdf") and AdaFruit ("AdaFruit Color-Changing LEDs Receipt.pdf") in this folder, too.

I'm probably going to take a break until Monday on this, since I kind of need the LEDs to continue anyway and I have the Neopixel libraries installed on my ArduinoIDE already (from mine Andrew's and Lily's Rapid Prototyping project last semester). I also ended up not getting to stop working last weekend; slowed down a little (from, like, multiple all-nighters all that week), but haven't stopped &mdash; been working on straggler assignments and such post-finals &mdash; since then. I have Mother's Day stuff planned for Saturday and Sunday this weekend. Saturday and Sunday might be stressful; my Dad makes things **real** weird around here on Mother's Day (and Father's Day, for that matter, if he's even here then, which usually he isn't). I'd like to be finished with work for a few days on Friday, though, and Friday should be nice; Elle and I are going to hang out with our one friend we're seeing during quarantine that afternoon/night. Going to rest up this weekend. 

And, thanks for your message over the weekend. (It's a hard time right now...) It means a lot. 

Check in on Monday, hope you get some rest this weekend too, and thanks again,

~ Fiona
